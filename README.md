[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/41da59890b574b7aa6c756b414d892a5)](https://www.codacy.com?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=saivittalb/wdi-dashboard-ui&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is an Open Source Bootstrap User Template. But this is not just another UI dashboard template. It goes way beyond hitherto templates thanks to transparent code and file structure. And if that's not enough, let’s just add that it consists bunch of unique features and over 1000 high quality icons. Front end developed using Angular. Made using Visual Studio Code.

This is meant to be the UX game changer. Pure & transparent code is devoid of redundant components, so the app is light enough to offer ultimate user experience. This means mobile devices also, where the navigation is just as easy and intuitive as on a desktop or laptop. The Layout API lets you customize your project for almost any device – be it Mobile, Web or WebApp – covers them all!

This UI was hard coded to fit the WDI World Bank Data as part of a hackathon. It can be easily edited and be used as a multipurpose dashboard! :)
